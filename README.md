#SteeringWheel

This was a university Project done by me and my collegue Patrick. 
The goal was to buld a steering wheel and pedal box for a simulator. 
Besides building these two components to work inside a formula studen racecar we created parts that are printable on a 20 cm x 20 cm 3D-printer and can be used without alot of other equipment.

Needed for this project:
* Arduino Micro
* USB-B Cable
* 3 Potentiometer for example RV16AF-20-15R-B5K-3
* 2-4 pushbutton for example  TC-R13-507A-05RT
* 2 springs for example: "GuteKunst federn" T-18509L, stronger would be better.
* 30cm of steel tubing
* A baseplate for the steering wheel (Wood, Steel, Carbon etc.)
* wires.

A German project description including some pictures of the actual project can be found inside the pdf document.
